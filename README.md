# Custom Hass.io Add-on: Homegear

See here for the documentation of this addon: https://github.com/yeah/hassio-addons

## What is different

Most likely this addon is not helpful for you. I removed everything i don't need.

This addon only supports the max family and it only works with a nanoCul on /dev/ttyUSB0.
